                            ahead of WTC final: Sarandeep</h1>
                    </div>
                    <div class="newsItalicSummaryDiv">
                        <h2>The former India spinner has also
                            backed Shardul Thakur to play the summit clash against New Zealand</h2>
                    </div>

                    <div class="newsArticalContentDiv">
                        <p>Former India off-spinner Sarandeep Singh reckons the ICC should have arranged
                            a warm-up match for India ahead of the World test Championship (WTC) final,
                            which will begin from June 18. There have been concerns as to how India will
                            fare in the final without any practice games and their opponents New
                            Zealand, on the other hand, will go into the game at the back of playing two
                            Tests against the hosts in England.</p>
                        <p>"The ICC should've arranged a three-day practice match for the Indian team to
                            help them prepare for the WTC final. If the counties aren't free, it
                            could've persuaded the ECB to arrange a second for the second XI of some
                            county. While New Zealand would come into this match on the back of a
                            two-Test series against hosts England, India would be left without match
                            practice despite facing completely different conditions than what they
                            encounter at home. Clearly, the Kiwis would have an edge, when it should be
                            a case of equal opportunity for both the teams," Sarandeep told
                            <em>TOI</em>.
                        </p>
                        <p>"No matter how much you practice in the nets, a warm-up game before playing a
                            Test on foreign soil is a must," he further added.</p>
                        <p>The former India selector also questioned the scheduling of the final. After
                            the final, India will have a long gap from their next assignment, which is
                            the five-match Test series against England, starting August 4.&nbsp;</p>
                        <p>They will however get a three-week break after the WTC final and have been
                            asked to reassemble on July 14, ahead of the first Test at Trent Bridge.</p>
                        <p>Was the ECB reluctant to host the WTC final in July given that The Hundred
                            will be played then? &nbsp;"That wouldn't have been a problem. In Australia,
                            they play a Test match in the morning and the Big Bash League game at night
                            on the same day. How does that affect viewership," Sarandeep said.</p>
                        <p>Speaking of the combination for the WTC final, Sarandeep feels India should
                            go in with Shardul Thakur given his all-round abilities. "If the conditions
                            are overcast, seamer-friendly and windy, with the pitch offering a green
                            cover, as is most likely going to be, I would prefer to play Shardul any
                            day. He is a genuine swing bowler. Moreover, he adds depth to our batting,
                            which is critical," he said.&nbsp;</p>
                        <p>"We saw how his half-century (67) and that seventh-wicket partnership of 123
                            with Washington Sundar helped us win the deciding Test at Brisbane in
                            Australia. If an all-rounder like him is not around, your tail will start
                            after No 6, which is very risky," Sarandeep, a veteran of three Tests and
                            five ODIs added.</p>
