## About Our Project : 

Our project is a clone of a Cricket.com, where we can watch live cricket scores, fantasy team approximations. Analytics of cricket, information and past performance of the player as well. 

## Guide to Project:

We made the Full Home Page where Navbar is there for navigating to all the pages in the website. We made a full functioning cards which shows the information about Live matches ,previous matches and upcoming matches. Below that we create a news and video section as shown in website, where we can watch cricket related videos and also go through with all the cricket tournament news around the world.
We created criclytics page where by single click, user can get all the information about upcoming matches and previous matches. By clicking on the match card user will be redirected to another page where he/she can get all the statics of the match. 
There is also a Log-in functonality where user can sign up by using 10 digit mobile number,after putting mobile number we have to fill OTP (one time password ) for redirecting upto information page where user can fill his details , that details gonna saved in the local storage.
User can go through with numbers of articles and also able to mark as liked if he or she find any particular artical intresting . 

So this is basically our project. We were two members in the team and we completed the whole project in the construct week timeline.
