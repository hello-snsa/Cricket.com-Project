information and past performance of the player as well.
We make a Full Home Page where Navbar is there for navigating to all the pages in the website .
we make a full functioning cards which shows the information about Live matches ,previous matches and upcoming matches.
Below that we create a news and video section as shown in website, where we can watch cricket related videos and also go through with all the cricket
tournament news around the world.
We created criclytics page where by single click, user can get all the information about upcoming matches and previous matches.
by clicking on the match card we attach a new page there user can get all the statics there .
There is also a Log-in functonality where user can sign up by using 10 digit mobile number,after putting mobile number we have
to fill OTP (one time password ) for redirecting upto information page where user can fill his details , that details gonna saved in the local storage.
User can go throug with numberof articles and also liked those articles if he or she find that intresting .
